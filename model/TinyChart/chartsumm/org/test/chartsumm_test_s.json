However, in 2018, there's a sudden jump in the price to $2.7 million, and it further increases to $3.0 million in 2019.\n\nStarry Night, executed by Vincent van Gogh, demonstrates a volatile situation in the art market. The price fluctuates erratically between 2015 and 2017, starting at $100,000, peaking at $130,000 in 2017, and dropping to $90,000 in 2018. In 2019, there's another substantial increase, with the price reaching $115,000.\n\nThe Scream, painted by Edvard Munch, shows a dramatic price increase from 2017 to 2018. The price surged from $90,000 to $120,000, before slightly dropping to $115,000 in 2019. \n\nThese trends are clearly visible in the graph, with the prices of the paintings plotted on the y-axis and the years on the x-axis. Each painting is represented by a marker on a light gray background, and the exact price and year for each painting are annotated above it. A grid enhances the readability of the chart by providing a reference frame for the annotations. \n\nDespite the fluctuations, the Mona Lisa remains the most expensive painting over the period, followed by Starry Night and then The Scream. However, the price of the Mona Lisa has dropped significantly from its peak in 2018, suggesting a one-time adverse event or change that caused a sudden decline in its value. \n\nThe data shows a diverse range of values, with the highest price of $120,000 for Starry Night in 2017 and the lowest $85,000 for The Mona Lisa in 2015. There's also a noticeable outlier in the price of The Mona Lisa in 2018, which deviates significantly from its previous price, suggesting a one-time event or sudden change that caused a substantial increase in its value. \n\nIn conclusion, the chart provides a clear visual representation of the price trends in the art market for these three famous paintings over a five-year period.

Rhode Island has always voted for a major party candidate, choosing the Democratic-Republican Party's nominees in its first two elections, before voting for the Democratic Party's nominee 25 times, and the Republican candidate 24 times since 1856. The only time where Rhode Island did not vote for a major party candidate was in the 1856 election, where it voted for the Constitutional Union's nominee, Millard Fillmore, over the Know Nothing Party's Millard Fillmore. In the 2020 election, Rhode Island proved to be a comfortable victory for the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who won by a margin of just 2 percent of the popular vote."

The x-axis represents the years while the y-axis signifies the sugar output. The graph is marked with grid lines and each data point is annotated with the corresponding country name. \n\nThe graph shows a general upward trend in sugar output over the years for all three countries, with a few exceptions. For instance, there is a noticeable drop in sugar output in Mexico in the year 1920, which could be attributed to various factors such as economic downturns or changes in agricultural practices. Similarly, there is a sudden spike in sugar output in Canada in the year 1940, possibly due to an increase in available land or more favorable growing conditions. \n\nThe USA's sugar output shows a bimodal trend with two distinct peaks in the years 1905 and 1985, indicating two periods of significant increases. Canada and Mexico also exhibit a bimodal trend with their sugar output peaking in the years 1915 and 1970 respectively. \n\nIn terms of comparison, the USA consistently produces the highest amount of sugar among the three countries throughout the period, despite a general decline in recent years. Canada and Mexico follow closely behind, with their sugar output fluctuating but generally staying higher than those of the USA. \n\nThe chart also contains several outliers that could indicate the occurrence of unexpected events or anomalies in the data. For example, the sudden drop in sugar output in Mexico in 1920 and the abrupt increase in Canada in 1940 are considered as outliers in the data. \n\nThe title of the chart could be 'Northern American sugar output by country 1885-1988'. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled as 'Year' and 'Sugar output' respectively. The chart also contains a legend in the upper right corner that specifies which color corresponds to which country (Canada, Mexico, or the USA). \n\nThe background of the chart is light gray with a grid that helps in estimating the value of each data point. The background color of the chart does not affect the visibility of the data points. \n\nThe chart is saved as a PNG image file named'myplot.png'. The file size of the image is determined by the dimensions of the plot and the padding that is added for the legend and title.

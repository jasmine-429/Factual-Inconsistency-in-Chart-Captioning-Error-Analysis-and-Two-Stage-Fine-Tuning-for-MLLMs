History During the end of the 18th century British public schools, almost exclusively attended by boys from the more affluent upper classes, were governed by strict and often cruel disciplinary action in lessons. In contrast to this, the Masters were almost entirely ambivalent to the activities that took place outside the classroom, resulting in a culture of bullying and brutality that persisted into the 19th century. During this time the Masters were also almost entirely ambivalent to the financial situation of their school, resulting in mismanagement of funds and widespread waste. In contrast to this, the Headmaster of Rugby School, Dr Thomas Arnold recognized the potential of a group sport activity to occupy the time of the mischievous students whilst simultaneously introducing positive Christian values, in a concept known as ‘ muscular Christianity'_. The successful use of games as a vehicle for achieving social control in Rugby School lead to a similar application of muscular Christianity across the increasingly expanding number of public schools. Although many schools adopted a form of group competitive activity, the precise rules of the game varied considerably from school to school, often formed by former public school boy that wished to continue participating in their sport. In the late 19th Century two proponents of the game published a letter in The Times suggesting that a national governing body should be established to regulate the game, however the letter was largely ignored. The first national governing body for the game was established in 1894, the Rugby Football Union ( RFU ), with the primary objective of governing the game, but also to promote the ‘ muscular Christianity'_'_, raise funds for charity, and improve the playing standards of both amateur and professional players. Although the precise rules of the game varied from club to club, the general objective was to have a governing body that could make decisions regarding player selection, competition structure and overall game standards. In the beginning the Rugby Football Union was made up of the leading public schools, but as the game grew in popularity it increasingly drew in schools from outside of the public system. In the first half of the 20th century the Rugby Football Union also began to make decisions regarding the financial standards of the clubs, however mismanagement of funds and a culture of waste continued to plague the organization. In the late 1990s a group of former public schoolboys that wished to continue participating in their sport formed the Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) Charitable Trust, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of rugby union, it ’"

From looking at other data sets , we know that this figure was as high as 7,200 deaths per million in some years , as individual epidemics regularly devastated large portions of the population . When Jenner 's findings on vaccination were adopted by the scientific community in Europe , Sweden was one of the first countries to begin vaccinating infants on a large scale . This is reflected in the considerable decline of smallpox deaths in the early nineteenth century , where the number of deaths fell to just 623 annual smallpox deaths per million in the first decade . By the middle of the century , when vaccination was made compulsory by the Swedish government , it dropped even further , to less than ten percent of the pre-vaccination death rate . In the last two decades in the nineteenth century , when Swedish authorities began penalizing parents for not vaccinating their children , the smallpox death rate fell to just two deaths per million people , and Sweden reported its final endemic ( naturally occurring ) case of smallpox in 1895 ; making it the second country in the world ( after Iceland in 1872 ) to successfully eradicate the disease .", "task_type": "sharegpt_chat_sft"}

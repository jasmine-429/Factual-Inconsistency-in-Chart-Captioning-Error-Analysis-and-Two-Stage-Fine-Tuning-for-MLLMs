One of the lines represents an equation, which shows the relationship between a variable and its value. The other line represents the output of the equation, which is represented by a line that is either above or below a horizontal axis.\n\nThe equation on the left side of the chart is written as \"George + 12345.\" The variable \"George\" is a placeholder for any real or imaginary value that is being added to a constant. The purpose of the equation is to illustrate the fact that adding a constant to a value of \"George\" does not change that value. For example, if \"George\" is already equal to 45, then adding 12345 also results in \"George\" being equal to 46. This shows that adding a constant to a value does not change the value."

The spread of the data ranges from the minimum time, e.g., 10 for 'Sports Games', to the maximum time at 90 for 'Board Games'. The median times are consistent across all games with 'Esports' having the shortest at 30 and 'Sports Games' the longest at 90. The outliers indicate that 'Board Games' has one at 95, while the other types of games do not have any. The median times show no significant difference within each game type."

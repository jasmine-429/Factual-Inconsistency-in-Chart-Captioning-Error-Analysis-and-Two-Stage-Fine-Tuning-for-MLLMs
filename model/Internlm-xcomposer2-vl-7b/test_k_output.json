This suggests that over the span of six decades, the availability of internal renewable water resources per person in Palestine has significantly diminished."

The HDI is a composite measure of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, often used to rank countries' development levels. The line representing Panama's HDI shows an upward trend over the 30-year period, indicating improvement in its development status. In 1990, the HDI was approximately 0.68, and it increased steadily each year until reaching a peak of around 0.82 by 2020. This suggests that Panama has made significant progress in human development over these decades."

The overall trend suggests that there was a severe outbreak of polio in Angola around the turn of the millennium, which was then effectively controlled, leading to a reduction in the number of cases reported in the following years."

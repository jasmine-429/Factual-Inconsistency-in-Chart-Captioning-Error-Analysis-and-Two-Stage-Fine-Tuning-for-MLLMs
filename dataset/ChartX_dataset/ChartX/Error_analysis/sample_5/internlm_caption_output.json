The number of Facebook users has seen a steady increase, starting at approximately 1.6 million in 2015 and reaching just over 2.7 million by 2019. Twitter users have also experienced growth, with numbers rising from around 0.3 million in 2015 to about 0.9 million in 2019. In contrast, Instagram users have shown the most significant growth, beginning at around 0.2 million in 2015 and surging to nearly 3 million by 2019. This suggests that while all three platforms are growing their user base, Instagram's growth rate is particularly high."

Over the next few years, there is a noticeable increase in both categories. By 2025, renewable energy production has more than doubled to approximately 1400 metric tons, while carbon emissions have increased significantly to nearly 5500 metric tons. This suggests an overall increase in the use of renewable energy sources and a corresponding rise in carbon emissions, possibly indicating a shift towards more sustainable energy practices but also highlighting the environmental impact associated with energy production."

For example, the cost per mile for public transit in New Orleans, Los Angeles, and San Diego is much lower compared to taxis and private vehicles, suggesting that these modes are more efficient and cost-effective options for shorter trips. On the other hand, private vehicles are more expensive for longer trips, particularly in cities like San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, where the cost per mile is higher.\n\nThe graph also highlights the difference in cost between different cities, with the monthly cost per mile in Los Angeles being significantly higher than that in New Orleans, for example, indicating that the transportation costs in larger cities might be more expensive due to higher living expenses or the presence of more expensive modes of transportation such as private vehicles.\n\nOverall, this chart provides a useful insight into the monthly cost of transportation modes in various cities, with emphasis on the distance covered in each month."

Meanwhile, smartphone sales continued to rise from 2016, with a noticeable spike from 2018 to 2020, followed by a more moderate increase until 2022. This suggests that Internet users are not as actively using smartphones as in previous years, and smartphone sales are not as strong as they were in the early 2020s."

Overall, both categories have shown an increasing trend, with the growth of fast food sales being significantly higher than that of food sales. The fast food sales trend line is steeper and more consistent throughout the graph, indicating that this category has been experiencing a greater increase in demand and sales than food. This suggests that fast food restaurants are becoming more popular and appealing to consumers, possibly due to their convenience, affordability, and the variety of menu options available."

The chart shows that ticket sales are expected to increase from 2019 to 2023, reaching 1000 million dollars by 2023. Growth in digital media consumption is also expected to increase, reaching 800 million dollars by 2023. Sports event attendance is expected to increase from 400 million dollars in 2019 to 600 million dollars by 2023. Finally, box office revenue is expected to increase from 0 million dollars in 2019 to 1 billion dollars by 2023."
